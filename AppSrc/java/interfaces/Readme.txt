These files contain interfaces for the user-interface and the logic.
MapData and BeaconData are classes to define a interface to prepared data.
The other classes occour in pairs of one logic-interface (named '-Logic', should be implemented by the logic)
and one ui-interface (named '-UI', should be implemented by the ui).
